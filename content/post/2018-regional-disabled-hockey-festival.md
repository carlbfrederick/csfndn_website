The Coach Sauer Foundation was proud to offer financial support to the 2018 
Regional Disabled Hockey Festival, which was held March 17-18 at Madison Ice 
Arena. There were 13 youth and adult teams from Wisconsin, Illinois and 
Minnesota who took part in three games apiece at the two-day event, which 
celebrated sled hockey, special hockey and the disabled athletes.

Below are a few pictures from the event:
