Thank you to the rest of the deserving finalists. It is heartening to hear about all the wonderful 
things that Wisconsin's high school hockey players are doing.

The Jeff Sauer Award, modeled after the collegiate Hockey Humanitarian Award, recognizes Wisconsin high school 
hockey players—male or female—who give back to their communities in the true humanitarian spirit. It is 
awarded annually at the Wisconsin Hockey Coaches Association State Tournament Awards Banquet.
