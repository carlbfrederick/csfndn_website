MADISON - Two students have been named as finalists for the fifth annual Jeff 
Sauer Humanitarian Award, which is presented annually to recognize good high 
school hockey players being great people.

The nominees are Andrew Budzinski, a senior defenseman from Madison Edgewood; 
and Luke Lindsay, a senior defenseman from Eau Claire Memorial. 

The annual award hopes to encourage community service among girls and boys high 
school hockey players in the state of Wisconsin. Shane Ryan, a goalie from 
Madison Edgewood, was the first recipient, Parker Esswein of Wauwatosa East and 
the Brookfield Stars won the award in 2019, Ava Jambor of Middleton High School 
and the Metro Lynx in 2020 and Zoe Uihlein, from Milwaukee University School 
was last year's winner. It is named after the legendary former University of 
Wisconsin coach and hockey ambassador Jeff Sauer, who passed away in February, 
2017.

The Coach Sauer Foundation, which sponsors the award, was very impressed with 
all the nominated candidates and their stories of student athletes who deserve 
notice for reasons that ultimately are more important than mere personal 
statistics.

The award will be presented March 3 at the Wisconsin High School Hockey Coaches 
annual banquet prior to the state tournament.
