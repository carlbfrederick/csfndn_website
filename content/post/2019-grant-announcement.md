The Coach Sauer Foundation is proud to announce that seven hockey organizations 
have received grant distributions in 2019.

Four youth hockey associations in Wisconsin will receive grants. They are the 
**Somerset Youth Hockey Association** to provide equipment to players in need; the 
**Beloit Youth Hockey Association** to help purchase junior intermediate nets; the 
**Spooner Ice Association** to help expand area youth tournament and **DC Diamonds 
from Waunakee** to help increase opportunities for girls only hockey in Dane 
County. 

The Foundation also awarded a grant to **Coulee Region Sled Hockey in LaCrosse** to
expand opportunities for older players.

Previously the Foundation announced it will provide financial support for the 
Polar Cats’ “Hockey for Life” program in Madison and will underwrite the 
Regional Disabled Hockey Festival for the third year. The Festival will be a 
season-opening event for the first time and move from its traditional March 
dates to the fall and take place from Oct. 18-20 at Madison Ice Arena. The 
annual Regional Disabled Festival is an opportunity for sled hockey and special 
hockey teams to enjoy a weekend of hockey competition and camaraderie, at no 
cost for participation.

The Coach Sauer Foundation also awarded financial support to the American 
Hearing Impaired Hockey Association to help defray costs so that Team USA may 
compete in the Deaflympics in December in Italy.

The Foundation is named after the late Jeff Sauer who won two national 
championships at the University of Wisconsin and also coached Team USA to a 
gold medal in the Paralympics. In its three years the Foundation has 
established the Jeff Sauer Award for Wisconsin high school hockey 
humanitarians, subsidize the Regional Disabled Hockey Festival, and provide 
financial support to youth hockey organizations throughout the state.  

Its mission is to continue Jeff's passion for using the game of hockey to help
others. The Foundation is dedicated to providing more opportunities to play the
game of hockey and support programs, both able-bodied and disabled, that 
emphasize the development of youth hockey players, coaches, and officials.

The Coach Sauer Foundation will hold its annual fundraiser Nov. 14 at Blackhawk 
Country Club in Madison and celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Miracle on 
Ice U.S. Olympic hockey team. Featured guests include Mark Johnson and John 
Harrington, two members of the gold-medal winning team.
