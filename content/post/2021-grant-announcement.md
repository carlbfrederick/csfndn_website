The purpose of the Coach Sauer Foundation Opportunity Grant program is to grow
the game of hockey by providing financial help to players and organizations to 
expand accessibility and provide new experiences.  Non-profit hockey 
associations, ice arenas, and other organizations are invited to apply for 
financial support to enable the execution of their plans to increase 
opportunities for youth participation and enjoyment of the game of hockey.  The
Foundation seeks to support both able-bodied and disabled athletes, coaches, 
and officials from across the state or country.  Specific areas of interest 
include, but are not limited to:

- Subsidization of player equipment, registration, or other participation fees.
- Support for the procurement of training equipment to enhance the effectiveness
   and player enjoyment of practices.
- Support for tournaments, clinics, or other events to promote participation 
  and skill development.
- Subsidization of education or training fees for coaches, officials, or other 
  association members.
- Support of efforts to increase participation from under-represented demographic 
  groups or geographic regions.

Applications will be reviewed by the Coach Sauer Foundation Grants Committee and 
evaluated on the basis of potential impact, targeted demographics, geographic 
area to be served, funds availability, and other factors.  Typical award values 
are expected to be in the $500 to $1000 range, but will be evaluated on a 
case-by-case basis.

Completed applications for the 2021-2022 season must be submitted by 
**September 15, 2021** to be considered for funding.  Applicants will be notified 
of funding decisions by September 30, 2021.  Completed application forms can be
