Press release below:

MADISON – Parker Esswein, a senior forward from Wauwatosa East High School 
and the Brookfield Stars, has been named the recipient of the Jeff Sauer 
Award, the Coach Sauer Foundation announced.

The Jeff Sauer Award was presented Wednesday at the Wisconsin High School 
Coaches Association dinner by Tony Granato, the head coach at the University 
of Wisconsin. The annual award hopes to encourage community service among 
girls and boys high school hockey players in the state of Wisconsin. It is 
named after the legendary former UW coach and hockey ambassador Jeff Sauer, 
who passed away in February, 2017.

The Jeff Sauer Award’s goal is to recognize good high school hockey players 
being great people.

Esswein is a worthy example. Parker completed 200 hours of volunteer service 
in the last four years. He served as the captain of both the Wauwatosa East 
baseball team and the Stars’ hockey team and was Brookfield’s third leading 
scorer this season with nine goals, 15 assists and 24 points. The Stars are 
a co-op team consisting of members from nine schools. 

Parker plays trumpet in the band, serves on the Student Athlete Advisory 
Council at Wauwatosa East where he helped organize a fundraiser for the 
American Heart Association. Parker has also been involved with his baseball 
team’s fundraiser where they sold Christmas trees and coaches four times a 
month in the youth hockey programs for the Elmbrook Eagles and Brookfield 
Stars. 

Esswein has a 4.0 grade point average and plans to study biomedical 
engineering in college because he was inspired by the medical advances 
which have helped his five-year old-hearing-impaired brother through 
heart surgery.  His coach is Greg Copeland, who was a finalist for the 
college Hockey Humanitarian Award in 2009 and serves as a trustee for 
the award.

Esswein was one of four finalists. The others were Dane Luebke, a senior 
defenseman from Waunakee; Haley Meskin, a senior forward from the Metro 
Lynx and Madison West, and Luke Trittelwitz, a senior defenseman from the 
WSFLG Blizzard and Grantsburg High School.

The Coach Sauer Foundation was very impressed with all the candidates and 
their stories of student athletes who deserve notice for reasons that 
ultimately are more important than mere personal statistics. 

The Jeff Sauer Award is modeled after the Hockey Humanitarian Award, 
which is presented annually to college hockey’s finest citizen and seeks 
to recognize players, male or female, who contribute to local communities 
in a true humanitarian spirit.
