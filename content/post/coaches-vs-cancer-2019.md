University School of Milwaukee won the WIAA state boys hockey championship 
March 2, but exactly one month earlier, the USM boys hockey team hosted 
Homestead at the USM Ice Arena for a Coaches Vs. Cancer game with proceeds and 
donations going to the Coach Sauer Foundation. 

The idea for the Coaches vs. Cancer game benefiting the Coach Sauer Foundation 
this year started with Wildcat players Casey Roepke, Robby Newton, and Coach 
Jason Woods.  Sandra Uihlein designed special jerseys for the game with the JS 
logo on the chest, and the high schools designed shirts with the JS logo on the 
back.  The proceeds from the game, shirt and additional jersey sales, and 
donations collected in the stands totaled $465.00. 

The two teams will continue to wear the jerseys every year when they play each 
other.
