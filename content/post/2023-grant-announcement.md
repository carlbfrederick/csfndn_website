Wisconsin Youth Hockey Organizations are encouraged to apply for a 2023-2024
hockey season grant! The purpose of the Coach Sauer Foundation Opportunity
Grant is to grow the game of hockey by providing financial help to players and
organizations, to expand accessibility and provide new experiences. Non-profit
hockey associations, ice arenas, and other organizations are invited to apply
for financial support to enable the execution of their plans to increase
opportunities for youth participation and enjoyment of the game of hockey. 

The Coach Sauer Foundation seeks to support both able-bodied and disabled
athletes, coaches and officials from across the state of Wisconsin. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Subsidization of player equipment, registration or other participation fees
- Support for tournaments, clinics, or other events to promote participation
  and skill development
- Subsidization of education or training fees for coaches, officials or other
  association members
- Support of efforts to increase participation from under-represented
  demographic groups or geographic regions

Applications will be reviewed by the Coach Sauer Foundation Grants Committee
and evaluated on the basis of potential impact, targeted demographics,
geographic area to be served, funds availability and other factors. Typical
award values are expected to be in the $500 - $1000 range, but will be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
