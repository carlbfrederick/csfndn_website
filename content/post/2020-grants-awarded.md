The Coach Sauer Foundation is proud to announce that three hockey organizations
have received grant distributions in the 2020-21 season.

Three youth hockey associations in Wisconsin will receive grants. They are the 
**Somerset Youth Hockey Association** to provide equipment to players in need; 
the **Dodgeville/Mineral Point Ice Wolves Youth Hockey Association** to help buy 
cleaning supplies to deal with COVID-19 health and safety issues regarding players 
and their families and to help purchase a new chiller; and the **Spooner Ice 
Association** to help expand an area youth tournament.

The Coach Sauer Foundation also plans to award the fourth annual Jeff Sauer 
Humanitarian Award to a Wisconsin high school player who exemplifies fine 
character, sportsmanship and citizenship. The recipient will be announced in 
February
