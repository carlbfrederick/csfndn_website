Senior defenseman Luke Lindsay, the captain of the Eau Claire Memorial hockey 
team, has been named the recipient of the Jeff Sauer Humanitarian Award, the 
Coach Sauer Foundation announced.

The Jeff Sauer Award was presented Thursday at the Wisconsin High School Hockey 
Coaches Association dinner in Madison. The annual award has been presented for 
the last five years and aims to encourage community service among girls and boys 
high school hockey players in Wisconsin.

It is named after the legendary former UW coach and hockey ambassador Jeff 
Sauer, who passed away in February, 2017. The Jeff Sauer Humanitarian Award’s 
goal is to recognize good high school hockey players being great people.

Lindsay has been active in Eau Claire doing volunteer service in the last four 
years.  Lindsay is the president of the Partner’s Club which serves students 
with special needs. He also was an integral part of leading a Thanksgiving food 
drive that raised $1,200 for the Community Table, an organization that provides 
food for the homeless and food insecure people in Eau Claire. Luke helped create 
and, with his Old Abes’ co-captain, organized a “tie blankets in the trees 
program” where fleece blankets were available to the homeless that lived near 
Hobbs Arena. The unused blankets were donated to the Sojourner House that served 
as a homeless shelter in the Eau Claire area. Luke also rang bells for the 
Salvation Army and worked with the mini mite hockey program in Eau Claire

On the ice, Lindsay is a second team all-state defenseman who was the Old Abe’s 
third leading scorer this season with 18 goals, 19 assists and 37 points. He 
hopes to play junior hockey and eventually play in college.

The other finalist for the award was Andrew Budzinski, a four-year defenseman 
for Madison Edgewood. Budzinski had six assists in his season for the state 
tournament-bound Crusaders and off the ice spent over 100 hours reading to the 
elderly and teaching technology skills at the Jefferson, a Madison west side 
retirement home.

Previous winners have come from all over the state and include two boys and 
two girls, including Zoe Uihlein of Milwaukee University School last year.
