MADISON – Four students have been named as finalists for the fourth annual Jeff
Sauer Award, which is presented annually to recognize good high school hockey 
players being great people.

The nominees include two boys and two girls from throughout Wisconsin.

They are Luke Hessenauer, a senior defenseman from Milton; Braden Kloida, a 
senior defenseman from the Brookfield Stars; Alyssa Knauf a senior forward from 
Albany and the Rock County Fury; and Zoe Uihlein, a senior forward from 
Milwaukee University School.

The annual award hopes to encourage community service among girls and boys high
school hockey players in the state of Wisconsin. Shane Ryan, a goalie from 
Madison Edgewood, was the first recipient, Parker Esswein of Wauwatosa East and 
the Brookfield Stars won the award in 2019 and Ava Jambor of Middleton High 
School and the Metro Lynx was last year’s winner. It is named after the 
legendary former University of Wisconsin coach and hockey ambassador Jeff Sauer, 
who passed away in February, 2017.

The Coach Sauer Foundation, which sponsors the award, was very impressed with 
all the nominated candidates and their stories of student athletes who deserve 
notice for reasons that ultimately are more important than mere personal 
statistics.

The award will be presented next week as part of the Wisconsin High School 
Hockey Coaches annual banquet prior to the state tournament, which will be held
virtually this season.
