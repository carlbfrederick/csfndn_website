MADISON â€“ Eight students have been nominated for the second Jeff 
Sauer Award, presented annually to recognize good high school hockey players 
being great people.

The nominees include four boys and four girls from throughout Wisconsin.

They are Katie Benson, a senior from Ashwaubenon and the Bay Area Ice Bears; 
Parker Esswein, a senior from Wauwatosa East and the Brookfield Stars; Dayne 
Hagedorn, a senior from Wausau West; Haley Knauf a junior from Albany and the 
Rock County Fury; Dane Luebke, a senior from Waunakee; Haley Meskin, a senior 
from Madison West and the Metro Lynx; Annelise Swiggum, a freshman from Black 
River Falls, and Luke Trittelwitz, a senior from Grantsburg and the WSFLG 
Blizzard.

The annual award hopes to encourage community service among girls and boys 
high school hockey players in the state of Wisconsin. Shane Ryan, a goalie from 
Madison Edgewood, was the first recipient. It is named after the legendary 
former University of Wisconsin coach and hockey ambassador Jeff Sauer, who 
passed away in February, 2017.

The Coach Sauer Foundation, which sponsors the award, was very impressed with 
all the nominated candidates and their stories of student athletes who deserve 
notice for reasons that ultimately are more important than mere personal 
statistics.

Tony Granato, who played for Sauer and is currently the coach of the Badgers, 
will present the Jeff Sauer Award Feb. 27 on the eve of the Wisconsin 
Interscholastic Athletic Association state hockey tournament.
