MADISON – Zoe Uihlein, a senior from University School of Milwaukee, has been 
named the recipient of the 2021 Jeff Sauer Humanitarian Award, the Coach Sauer 
Foundation announced.

The Jeff Sauer Award was presented Friday at the Wisconsin High School Coaches 
Association virtual banquet. The annual award hopes to encourage community 
service among girls and boys high school hockey players in the state of 
Wisconsin. It is named after the legendary former University of Wisconsin coach 
and hockey ambassador Jeff Sauer, who passed away in February, 2017.

The Jeff Sauer Award’s goal is to recognize good high school hockey players 
being great people.

Zoe is a volunteer with the Wisconsin Adaptive Sports Association, a nonprofit 
that promotes community collaboration on sports and recreational opportunities 
for individuals with mobility and visual impairments in wheelchair basketball, 
lacrosse, softball, tennis and bowling, and the WASA Admirals Sled Hockey 
Programs in Milwaukee. “She brings energy to all her volunteer work” was a 
constant refrain about Zoe who also plays lacrosse as USM. An honor student, 
Zoe’s college plans are still up in the air.

Uihlien will play in the WIAA girls state championship game Saturday against 
Chippewa Falls/Menomonie in Wisconsin Rapids. A defender, she has one goal and 
eight points this season and has 4 goals, 14 assists and 18 points in her prep 
career. Her coach is Dan Carey. 

Uihlein was one of four finalists for the award. The others are Braden Kloida, 
a senior defenseman from the Brookfield Stars and Brookfield East High School; 
Alyssa Knauf, a senior forward from the Rock County Fury and Albany High School, 
and Luke Hessenauer, a senior defenseman from Milton High School.

The Jeff Sauer Award is modeled after the Hockey Humanitarian Award, which is 
presented annually to college hockey’s finest citizen and seeks to recognize 
players, male or female, who contribute to local communities in a true 
humanitarian spirit. 

After retiring as one of the top ten winningest coaches in college hockey, Jeff 
worked extensively with disabled hockey players, He coached the U.S. sled 
hockey team to a gold medal at the Winter Paralympics in 2014 and in his seven 
years as coach, Team USA won two gold medals at the Sledge Hockey World 
Championships. Additionally, Sauer was president of the American Hearing 
Impaired Hockey Association.

The Coach Sauer Foundation was very impressed with all the candidates and their 
stories of student athletes who deserve notice for their work in the community 
and for reasons that ultimately are more important than mere personal statistics.

Madison Ice Arena displays a replica of the Jeff Sauer Award in its lobby to 
honor Uihlein and the three past winners – Shane Ryan of Madison Edgewood, Parker 
Esswein of Wauwatosa East and the Brookfield Stars and Ava Jambor of the 
Middleton Lynx. University School will also receive a plaque to display to 
commemorate Uihlien’s achievements.
