# Jeff Sauer Award

Modeled after the collegiate Hockey Humanitarian Award, recognizes Wisconsin 
high school hockey players—male or female—who give back to their communities 
in the true humanitarian spirit.

It is awarded annually at the Wisconsin Hockey Coaches Association State 
Tournament Awards Banquet.

Shane Ryan, a senior goaltender from Madison Edgewood High School, was the 
first recipient of the Jeff Sauer Award. The award was presented by University 
of Wisconsin associate head coach Mark Strobel during Wednesday’s Wisconsin 
High School Coaches Association dinner.

The annual award was designed to encourage community service among girls and 
boys high school hockey players in Wisconsin. It is named after Jeff Sauer, 
the legendary former University of Wisconsin coach and hockey ambassador, who 
died in February, 2017. 

The Jeff Sauer Award’s goal is to recognize good high school hockey players 
being great people.

Ryan is a worthy example. Shane completed 230 hours of volunteer service. In 
the last four years Ryan worked as an umpire and a groundskeeper at the 
Madison West Side Little League fields.

He also created a fundraiser that provided scholarships to give to families 
that couldn’t afford baseball equipment. Thus far Shane has raised $10,000 
for families at the Little League complex.

Shane had a 4.03 grade point average at Edgewood and now attends the University of 
Wisconsin. As a three-year player at Edgewood, Ryan had a 14-9-1 
record with a 2.23 goals against average and an 8.98 save percentage. 
His coach was Pete Rothering.

Ryan was one of four finalists for the award.

The others were Russell Albee, a junior goaltender from the Brookfield 
Stars; Maddie Gibson, a junior forward from the Bay Area Ice Bears, and 
Baileigh Johnson, a senior forward from Black Rivers Falls Co-op.
