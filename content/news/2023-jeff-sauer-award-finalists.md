MADISON – Four students have been named as finalists for the sixth annual Jeff 
Sauer Humanitarian Award, which is presented annually to recognize good high 
school hockey players being great people. The nominees include two boys and two 
girls from throughout Wisconsin.

They are Brooke Brennan, a senior defenseman from Hayward co-op; Jack Redman, a
junior forward from Onalaska/LaCrosse; Autumn Cooper a junior forward from 
Superior; and Ben Accola, a senior forward from River Falls.

Abe Thompson of Madison Edgewood and Alex Poltratz of Hudson were also nominated 
for the award which hopes to encourage community service among girls and boys 
high school hockey players in the state of Wisconsin. Luke Lindsay of Eau Claire 
Memorial was last year’s winner. It is named after the legendary former 
University of Wisconsin coach and hockey ambassador Jeff Sauer, who passed away 
in February, 2017.

The Coach Sauer Foundation, which sponsors the award, was very impressed with 
all the nominated candidates and their stories of student athletes who deserve 
notice for reasons that ultimately are more important than mere personal 
statistics.

The award will be presented March 2 as part of the Wisconsin High School Hockey 
Coaches annual banquet prior to the state tournament.
