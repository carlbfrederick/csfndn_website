We are proud to provide financial support for the Regional Disabled Hockey Festival for the third year. The Festival will be a season-opening event for the first time and move from its traditional March dates to the fall and take place from **Oct. 18-20 at Madison Ice Arena**. The annual Regional Disabled Festival is an opportunity for sled hockey and special hockey teams to enjoy a weekend of hockey competition and camaraderie, at no cost for participation. Madison Ice Arena is equipped with special dasher boards for sled hockey, specially designed locker rooms for disabled hockey players and is an ADA compliant ice arena facility.
