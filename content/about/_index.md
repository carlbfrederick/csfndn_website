The Coach Sauer Foundation runs and supports programs in the state of Wisconsin and beyond, including:

### Regional Disabled Hockey Festival
The Coach Sauer Foundation will sponsor the 2018 Regional Disabled Hockey Festival, which will be held at Madison Ice Arena in March, 2018 and hosted by Wisconsin Skeeters Sled Hockey .

### Scholarship Fund
The purpose of the Scholarship Fund is to grow the game of hockey by providing financial help to players through non-profit hockey clubs and arenas. We hope to give families with financial hardship and opportunity for their young players with an opportunity to learn about the game of hockey. A committee will vote to disperse a determined amount each year to a number of applicants requesting financial assistance through their local non-profit hockey organization.
